# 🔒 Security Guidelines for SecureContract Pro

## 🚨 CRITICAL: API Key Exposure Fixed

**An exposed Resend API key was found in the git history and has been addressed:**
- ✅ Removed from current files
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to prevent future exposures
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: The old API key `re_J8oos3Wp_GPjKaMAtDtbqKZcppayQuxGu` must be rotated immediately

## 🔄 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate the Exposed API Key
1. Go to [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Delete the old key: `re_J8oos3Wp_GPjKaMAtDtbqKZcppayQuxGu`
3. Generate a new API key
4. Update your environment files with the new key

### 2. Update Environment Files
```bash
# Update backend/.env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_new_resend_api_key_here

# Update any deployment environment variables
```

## 🚨 NEVER COMMIT THESE TO GIT:
- API keys (Resend, Google Analytics, etc.)
- Private keys (Solana wallets, encryption keys)
- Database passwords
- JWT secrets
- Any `.env` files with real values
- Wallet files (`wallet.json`)

## ✅ Proper Secrets Management:

### 1. Environment Variables
- Use `.env.example` files as templates
- Copy to `.env` and fill with real values
- Never commit `.env` files

### 2. Production Deployment
Use platform-specific environment variable settings:
- **Vercel**: Project Settings → Environment Variables
- **Netlify**: Site Settings → Environment Variables
- **AWS**: Parameter Store or Secrets Manager
- **Docker**: Use secrets or environment files

### 3. API Key Rotation
- Rotate API keys regularly (monthly recommended)
- Immediately rotate if exposed
- Use different keys for different environments

### 4. Git Security
- Always check commits before pushing: `git diff --cached`
- Use pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
- Review pull requests carefully

## 🔄 If You Accidentally Commit Secrets:

1. **Immediately rotate the exposed secrets**
2. **Remove from git history** (use the provided script)
3. **Force push the cleaned history**
4. **Notify team members to re-clone the repository**

## 📞 Emergency Response:
If secrets are exposed in a public repository:
1. Rotate ALL exposed secrets immediately
2. Run the security fix script: `./scripts/fix-exposed-secrets.sh`
3. Force push the cleaned repository
4. Monitor for any unauthorized usage

## 🛡️ Best Practices:
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Use secrets management services in production
- Enable 2FA on all service accounts

## 🔧 Security Tools:

### Pre-commit Hook (Recommended)
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << 'EOF'
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
EOF

# Install the hook
pre-commit install
```

### Git Hooks
Add to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for potential secrets before commit
if git diff --cached | grep -E "(api_key|secret|password|token)" -i; then
    echo "⚠️  Potential secret detected in commit!"
    echo "Please review your changes before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

## 📊 Monitoring:
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Regular access reviews
- Audit logs regularly

## 🎯 Compliance:
- Follow GDPR guidelines for data handling
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Ensure secure data transmission (HTTPS only)
- Regular penetration testing
